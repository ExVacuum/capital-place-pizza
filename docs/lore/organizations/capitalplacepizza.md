Capital Place Pizza is a fictional pizza place based in Indianapolis, and one of the main locations of interest in the ARG. 
Opened on October 30, 2019, the pizza place is located near the University of Indianapolis. Capital Place Pizza is owned by [John Dough](../characters/john),
and is the former workplace of [Jon Doe](../characters/jon), a design student at the university. Currently, the pizza place is presumed to be
connected to Papa John's Pizza in some way, due to various indicators which include the logo color palette, frequent use of the name "John" and its variants,
as well as the apparent relevance of events surrounding Papa John's, such as the death of [Daniel Jaffke](../characters/daniel).
