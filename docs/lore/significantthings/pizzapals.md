# Pizza Pals

Pizza pals refer to a subset of the [Dough Solvers](dough-solvers) which were given the role of <span style="color:red"><b>`Pizza Pal`</b></span> in the [Circle City Contamination](../organizations/contamination) Discord Server. 
The role was initially given the permission to view the server's [audit logs](../../assets/CCC_Audit_Log.zip), which revealed many seemingly unused locations and points of information in the ARG. This permission was promptly revoked later on. 
Pizza pals continue to have an enhanced set of privileges, with the ability to view the server settings, as well as manage emoji and webhooks.

If, for some reason, a user with these permissions is required, the current pizza pals are:
