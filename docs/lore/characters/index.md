<b>Jon Doe's Discord Profile Picture</b>

<h2> Bio </h2>
<hr>

<h3> Overview </h3>
<hr>

Jon Doe is a design student at <a href="https://herron.iupui.edu/">Herron School of Art and Design</a> in Indianapolis, and a former employee of <a href="../characters/john">John Dough</a> at <a href="../organizations/cppizza">Capital Place Pizza</a>.

<h3> First Contact </h3>
<hr>

The first known contact with the character was made by the <a href="../significant-things/dough-solvers">Dough Solvers</a> on the 25th of November, 2019, using the discord account <em>John4-16 #1608</em> under the alias &quot;Dover&quot;. 
Jon alerted the group to, and provided assistance with, <a href="../../reddit/pope">The Pope</a>. This sparked some suspicion. When confronted privately, Jon claimed not to be John Dough. This was true, however it established a precedent for Jon attempting to hide his identity from the Dough Solvers.

<h3> Contamination Server </h3>
<hr>

Once <a href="../../youtube/video-sixteen">Video 16</a> was released, the <a href="../organizations/contamination">Circle City Contamination</a> Discord Server was revealed in some <a href="../../youtube/video-sixteen#falling-characters">falling letters</a>. <a href="https://discord.gg/Uv2V7Ps">This server</a>, owned and moderated by Doe,
serves in part as a place for him to communicate with ARG participants. Much of the following content on this page was retrieved from conversations that took place between Jon and the <a href="../significant-things/pizza-pals">Pizza Pals</a>.

<h3>First Conversation</h3>
<hr>

The following conversation took place in the <code>#decontamination</code> channel of the <a href="https://discord.gg/Uv2V7Ps">discord server</a>. The first section took place at 9:03pm EST, December 11, 2019, following the discovery of the server by the members of the <a href="../significant-things/dough-solvers">Dough Solvers</a> who would go on to become the <a href="../significant-things/pizza-pals">Pizza Pals</a>:

<p style="background-color: rgba(207,207,207,0.93);border-radius: 5px;padding: 10px;">
[9:03 PM] Jon Doe: welcome to decontamination
<br>
[9:04 PM] Jon Doe: i am jon doe
<br>
[9:04 PM] Jon Doe: and i used to work for capital place pizza
<br>
<br>
[9:04 PM] Silas: Hey Jon
<br>
[9:04 PM] Silas: I'm Silas
<br>
<br>
[9:05 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: Hello Jon
<br>
<br>
[9:06 PM] Silas: How are we supposed to decontaminate an entire city?
<br>
<br>
[9:08 PM] Jon Doe: we cannot
<br>
[9:08 PM] Jon Doe: do you see the pattern between other ARG's
<br>
<br>
[9:09 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: They have complicated puzzles that go on for weeks?
<br>
<br>
[9:09 PM] Jon Doe: theyre marketing
<br>
<br>
[9:10 PM] Silas: Oh yeah like that Halo one
<br>
<br>
[9:10 PM] Jon Doe: but for us
<br>
[9:10 PM] Jon Doe: the medium is the message
<br>
<br>
[9:11 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: So you mean to say that this is not to market anything, but rather for us to just enjoy?
<br>
<br>
[9:11 PM] Silas: You're marketing puzzles?
<br>
<br>
[9:12 PM] Jon Doe: im marketing the problem
<br>
[9:13 PM] Jon Doe: the problem with pizza
<br>
<br>
[9:13 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: The problem is that it's too cheesy
<br>
[9:13 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: Right?
<br>
<br>
[9:14 PM] Jon Doe: that sounds like an intolerant individual
<br>
<br>
[9:14 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: I apologize
<br>
<br>
[9:14 PM] Jon Doe: no need
<br>
[9:14 PM] Jon Doe: you have all done well
<br>
[9:14 PM] Jon Doe: missed quite a lot though :wink:
<br>
[9:15 PM] Jon Doe: a puzzle with missing pieces is a disapointment
<br>
<br>
[9:15 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: Most missing pieces are found stuck in its box
<br>
[9:15 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: Where might you say that our box is, Mr. Doe?
<br>
<br>
[9:15 PM] Jon Doe: oh gosh hopefully not the trash
<br>
<br>
[9:15 PM] Silas: Womp womp
<br>
<br>
[9:16 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: Of course not, we need the box to see the picture
<br>
[9:16 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: Why throw away a guide?
</p>

After this introductory segment of the conversation, <a href="https://github.com/exvacuum">Silas</a> prompted Jon about his past with <a href="../organizations/cppizza">Capital Place Pizza</a>.
The conversation continued as follows:

<p style="background-color: rgba(207,207,207,0.93);border-radius: 5px;padding: 10px;">
[9:17 PM] Silas: You said you used to work for Capital Place Pizza. I'm curious as to what might have caused you to change occupations.
<br>
[9:18 PM] Silas: Although, I suppose it's related to the problem, isn't it?
<br><br>
[9:18 PM] Jon Doe: its a long story
<br>
[9:18 PM] Jon Doe: i tried to clue you in a bit in the hidden ones
<br>
[9:19 PM] Jon Doe: the problem
<br>
[9:19 PM] Jon Doe: john is watching
<br>
[9:19 PM] Jon Doe: so i cant be outright
<br>
[9:19 PM] Jon Doe: well hes not watching here, yet
<br>
[9:19 PM] Jon Doe: but hes watching everthing else
<br>
[9:21 PM] Jon Doe: so im a design student at herron
<br>
[9:21 PM] Jon Doe: and i work this night shift job so that i can go to school during the day
<br>
[9:22 PM] Jon Doe: the night shift isnt good for anything other than looking for other jobs -- at least in my department
<br>
[9:22 PM] Jon Doe: so thats what i did most of the time
<br>
[9:22 PM] Jon Doe: i was perusing craigslist when i found this job posting for a graphic design gig at a new pizza place
<br><br>
[9:23 PM] hyperlisk: Oh shit
<br><br>
[9:23 PM] Jon Doe: the money was twice as much and it was design work -- my major
<br>
[9:24 PM] Jon Doe: anyways i applied -- made this fancy pdf resume with embedded videos and stuff -- very proud
<br>
[9:25 PM] Jon Doe: i heard back almost immediately -- the guy was weird though
<br>
[9:26 PM] Jon Doe: he kept using words with the letter p like some sort of alliteration game
<br>
[9:27 PM] Jon Doe: he said my work was "perfect" but hed "prefer a prototype" of the concept before he "paid" me
<br>
[9:27 PM] Jon Doe: now i was desperate for a new gig and had tons of time to fuck around at night on a project
<br>
[9:27 PM] Jon Doe: so i figured i had nothing to lose
<br><br>
[9:28 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: What happened after you sent the prototype?
<br><br>
[9:29 PM] hyperlisk: Can you supply use with the "perfect" version?
<br><br>
[9:31 PM] Jon Doe: i didnt get a response
<br>
[9:31 PM] Jon Doe: i was pissed
<br>
[9:31 PM] Jon Doe: this was the spring and i had spent my mocking up this commercial for the guy and he ghosted me
<br>
[9:33 PM] Jon Doe: so summer comes and goes and the anger subsides and i kinda forget about it until october when i get an email from the guy
<br>
[9:34 PM] Jon Doe: "professing his apologies" with "permit problems" and blah blah blah but he said they were finally opening and that he could pay me
<br>
[9:34 PM] Jon Doe: and man let me tell you that money was sweet
<br>
[9:35 PM] Jon Doe: id been saving up all summer to get my own place near school so i could move out from my parents place
<br>
[9:35 PM] Jon Doe: i was sleeping in my car between shifts and class in the fall just to save up those last bits of a security deposit
<br>
[9:37 PM] Jon Doe: he also said he had more projects planned and wanted me to work for him part time
<br>
[9:38 PM] Jon Doe: part time at that pay was enough for me to quit my night job
<br>
[9:38 PM] Jon Doe: so i said yes
<br>
[9:39 PM] Jon Doe: as long as i got half up front
<br>
[9:39 PM] Jon Doe: saying yes was my first real mistake
<br>
[9:40 PM] Jon Doe: telling him about my "living-in-the-car" situation was my next one
<br>
[9:40 PM] Jon Doe: because it just so happened that he had the perfect place for me
<br><br>
[9:41 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: Did you tell anyone about where you were going to be staying?
<br><br>
[9:44 PM] Silas: I mean, how could you have known at the time?
<br><br>
[9:45 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: I still think that his parents should have at least known, since he was moving out

<h3> Significance to Lore </h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Jon is a student at <a href="https://herron.iupui.edu/">Herron School of Art and Design</a>.</li>
<li>Jon got in touch with <a href="../characters/john">John Dough</a> via a Craigslist listing.</li>
<li>Jon&#39;s work at <a href="../organizations/cppizza">Capital Place Pizza</a> involved graphic design.</li>
<li>This conversation essentially confirms that <a href="../characters/john">John Dough</a> interacts with the community through his accounts, by explaining his obsession with alliteration.</li>
<li>After Jon&#39;s initial application and mockup submission, John ghosted him, and communications between the two ceased until October of 2019.</li>
<li>In October, once <a href="../organizations/cppizza">Capital Place Pizza</a> opened, John got back in touch and hired Jon.</li>
<li>In hopes of getting a home of his own, Jon slept in his car while waiting for enough money for a down payment. Somehow, Jon revealed this fact to John, and apparently John had a place for Jon to stay.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3> Second Conversation </h3>

<hr>

On December 18, 2019, Jon re-established contact after abruptly ending the first conversation. The following conversation took place. 
Part of the way through this conversation, <code>#the-radio</code> voice channel became active, playing a selection of music, 
including songs by <i>The Mountain Goats</i>, as mentioned by <a href="https://gtihub.ocm/exvacuum">Silas</a>. 
ThatOnePerson2000 notes that the music bot's nickname is set to "Gary". The conversation occurs as follows:

<h3> Significance to Lore </h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>This conversation explains the purpose of <a href="../../reddit/pepperoni">the Pepperoni</a>: <a href="../characters/john">John Dough</a> has a keylogger on Jon&#39;s machine.
It is possible that Jon is, in fact, using a machine owned by John, this idea is substantiated by <a href="../../youtube/vidtwentyone">video 21</a>.</li>
<li>Jon thinks very poorly of John.</li>
<li>Jon wants to say more, however must wait until clear communication is possible.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3> Third Conversation </h3>

On the 9th of January, 2020, after a period of silence, Jon resurfaced, and the following conversation took place:

<h3> Significance to Lore </h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Jon had begun speaking in fancy letters in order to overcome the keylogger.</li>
<li>John owns an apartment in the <a href="../organizations/cpapartments">Capital Place Apartments</a> complex.</li>
<li>Jon has connections to Indianapolis skate culture.</li>
<li>Jon appears to suffer from some sort of anxiety disorder for which he takes medication in the form of Meridian diazepam auto-injections.</li>
<li>Jon is indeed held captive, in a room containing a sink, toilet, and bidet. This room can be seen in videos <a href="../../youtube/video-twenty">20</a> and <a href="../../youtube/video-twenty-one">21</a>.</li>
<li>Jon&#39;s fancy-text method of communication appears to have been intervened by John, or it is possible that the batteries in the <a href="../../youtube/video-twenty-one#laptop-section-2">old laptop</a> John provided him simply died.</li>
</ul>
<hr>


<h3> Jon's Escape </h3>
<hr>
 On January 31, 2020, Jon sent the following message to the CCC Discord server:
<p style="background-color: rgba(207,207,207,0.93);border-radius: 5px;padding: 10px;">
[10:42 PM] Jon Doe: I got out tonight.
<br>
[10:42 PM] Jon Doe: I'll never eat that pizza again.
<br>
[10:43 PM] Jon Doe: i will be back when i am feeling better
</p>

Jon has broken free from the room he was imprisoned in, as is depicted in <a href="../../youtube/video-twenty-one"></a> uploaded the following day.

<h3>Controversy</h3>
<hr>
In the time following Daniel&#39;s death, Papa John&#39;s announced a fundraiser for Daniel&#39;s family, as well as a scholarship in Daniel&#39;s name at the University of Indianapolis. Apparently, though over $14,000 were raised, Daniel&#39;s family never saw any money.
Daniel&#39;s family continues to hold a grudge against John Schnatter to this day.
