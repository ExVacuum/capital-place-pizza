**Jon Doe's Discord Profile Picture**

## Bio

### Overview

Jon Doe is a design student at [Herron School of Art and Design](https://herron.iupui.edu/) in Indianapolis, and a former employee of [John Dough](../characters/john) at [Capital Place Pizza](../organizations/cppizza).

### First Contact

The first known contact with the character was made by the [Dough Solvers](../significant-things/dough-solvers) on the 25th of November, 2019, using the discord account *John4-16 #1608* under the alias "Dover". 
Jon alerted the group to, and provided assistance with, [The Pope](../../reddit/pope). This sparked some suspicion. When confronted privately, Jon claimed not to be John Dough. This was true, however it established a precedent for Jon attempting to hide his identity from the Dough Solvers.

### Contamination Server

Once [Video 16](../../youtube/video-sixteen) was released, the [Circle City Contamination](../organizations/contamination) Discord Server was revealed in some [falling letters](../../youtube/video-sixteen#falling-characters). [This server](https://discord.gg/Uv2V7Ps), owned and moderated by Doe,
serves in part as a place for him to communicate with ARG participants. Much of the following content on this page was retrieved from conversations that took place between Jon and the [Pizza Pals](../significant-things/pizza-pals).

### First Conversation

The following conversation took place in the `#decontamination` channel of the [discord server](https://discord.gg/Uv2V7Ps). The first section took place at 9:03pm EST, December 11, 2019, following the discovery of the server by the members of the [Dough Solvers](../significant-things/dough-solvers) who would go on to become the [Pizza Pals](../significant-things/pizza-pals):

```
[9:03 PM] Jon Doe: welcome to decontamination
[9:04 PM] Jon Doe: i am jon doe
[9:04 PM] Jon Doe: and i used to work for capital place pizza

[9:04 PM] Silas: Hey Jon
[9:04 PM] Silas: I'm Silas

[9:05 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: Hello Jon

[9:06 PM] Silas: How are we supposed to decontaminate an entire city?

[9:08 PM] Jon Doe: we cannot
[9:08 PM] Jon Doe: do you see the pattern between other ARG's

[9:09 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: They have complicated puzzles that go on for weeks?

[9:09 PM] Jon Doe: theyre marketing

[9:10 PM] Silas: Oh yeah like that Halo one

[9:10 PM] Jon Doe: but for us
[9:10 PM] Jon Doe: the medium is the message

[9:11 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: So you mean to say that this is not to market anything, but rather for us to just enjoy?

[9:11 PM] Silas: You're marketing puzzles?

[9:12 PM] Jon Doe: im marketing the problem
[9:13 PM] Jon Doe: the problem with pizza

[9:13 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: The problem is that it's too cheesy
[9:13 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: Right?

[9:14 PM] Jon Doe: that sounds like an intolerant individual

[9:14 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: I apologize

[9:14 PM] Jon Doe: no need
[9:14 PM] Jon Doe: you have all done well
[9:14 PM] Jon Doe: missed quite a lot though :wink:
[9:15 PM] Jon Doe: a puzzle with missing pieces is a disapointment

[9:15 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: Most missing pieces are found stuck in its box
[9:15 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: Where might you say that our box is, Mr. Doe?

[9:15 PM] Jon Doe: oh gosh hopefully not the trash

[9:15 PM] Silas: Womp womp

[9:16 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: Of course not, we need the box to see the picture
[9:16 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: Why throw away a guide?
```

After this introductory segment of the conversation, [Silas](https://github.com/exvacuum) prompted Jon about his past with [Capital Place Pizza](../organizations/cppizza).
The conversation continued as follows:

```
[9:17 PM] Silas: You said you used to work for Capital Place Pizza. I'm curious as to what might have caused you to change occupations.
[9:18 PM] Silas: Although, I suppose it's related to the problem, isn't it?

[9:18 PM] Jon Doe: its a long story
[9:18 PM] Jon Doe: i tried to clue you in a bit in the hidden ones
[9:19 PM] Jon Doe: the problem
[9:19 PM] Jon Doe: john is watching
[9:19 PM] Jon Doe: so i cant be outright
[9:19 PM] Jon Doe: well hes not watching here, yet
[9:19 PM] Jon Doe: but hes watching everthing else
[9:21 PM] Jon Doe: so im a design student at herron
[9:21 PM] Jon Doe: and i work this night shift job so that i can go to school during the day
[9:22 PM] Jon Doe: the night shift isnt good for anything other than looking for other jobs -- at least in my department
[9:22 PM] Jon Doe: so thats what i did most of the time
[9:22 PM] Jon Doe: i was perusing craigslist when i found this job posting for a graphic design gig at a new pizza place

[9:23 PM] hyperlisk: Oh shit

[9:23 PM] Jon Doe: the money was twice as much and it was design work -- my major
[9:24 PM] Jon Doe: anyways i applied -- made this fancy pdf resume with embedded videos and stuff -- very proud
[9:25 PM] Jon Doe: i heard back almost immediately -- the guy was weird though
[9:26 PM] Jon Doe: he kept using words with the letter p like some sort of alliteration game
[9:27 PM] Jon Doe: he said my work was "perfect" but hed "prefer a prototype" of the concept before he "paid" me
[9:27 PM] Jon Doe: now i was desperate for a new gig and had tons of time to fuck around at night on a project
[9:27 PM] Jon Doe: so i figured i had nothing to lose

[9:28 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: What happened after you sent the prototype?

[9:29 PM] hyperlisk: Can you supply use with the "perfect" version?

[9:31 PM] Jon Doe: i didnt get a response
[9:31 PM] Jon Doe: i was pissed
[9:31 PM] Jon Doe: this was the spring and i had spent my mocking up this commercial for the guy and he ghosted me
[9:33 PM] Jon Doe: so summer comes and goes and the anger subsides and i kinda forget about it until october when i get an email from the guy
[9:34 PM] Jon Doe: "professing his apologies" with "permit problems" and blah blah blah but he said they were finally opening and that he could pay me
[9:34 PM] Jon Doe: and man let me tell you that money was sweet
[9:35 PM] Jon Doe: id been saving up all summer to get my own place near school so i could move out from my parents place
[9:35 PM] Jon Doe: i was sleeping in my car between shifts and class in the fall just to save up those last bits of a security deposit
[9:37 PM] Jon Doe: he also said he had more projects planned and wanted me to work for him part time
[9:38 PM] Jon Doe: part time at that pay was enough for me to quit my night job
[9:38 PM] Jon Doe: so i said yes
[9:39 PM] Jon Doe: as long as i got half up front
[9:39 PM] Jon Doe: saying yes was my first real mistake
[9:40 PM] Jon Doe: telling him about my "living-in-the-car" situation was my next one
[9:40 PM] Jon Doe: because it just so happened that he had the perfect place for me

[9:41 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: Did you tell anyone about where you were going to be staying?

[9:44 PM] Silas: I mean, how could you have known at the time?

[9:45 PM] ThatOnePerson2000: I still think that his parents should have at least known, since he was moving out
```

### Significance to Lore

- Jon's work at [Capital Place Pizza](../organizations/cppizza) involved graphic design.
- This conversation essentially confirms that [John Dough](../characters/john) interacts with the community through his accounts, by explaining his obsession with alliteration.

- In October, once [Capital Place Pizza](../organizations/cppizza) opened, John got back in touch and hired Jon.

### Second Conversation

On December 18, 2019, Jon re-established contact after abruptly ending the first conversation. The following conversation took place. 
Part of the way through this conversation, `#the-radio` voice channel became active, playing a selection of music, 
including songs by *The Mountain Goats*, as mentioned by [Silas](https://gtihub.ocm/exvacuum). 
ThatOnePerson2000 notes that the music bot's nickname is set to "Gary". The conversation occurs as follows:

### Significance to Lore

- This conversation explains the purpose of [the Pepperoni](../../reddit/pepperoni): [John Dough](../characters/john) has a keylogger on Jon's machine.
It is possible that Jon is, in fact, using a machine owned by John, however this idea is not substantiated.
- Jon thinks very poorly of John.
- Jon wants to say more, however must wait until clear communication is possible.
