## Bio
Daniel Jaffke was a 30-year old musician and Papa John's delivery driver. 
He was shot and killed on Jan. 31, 2014 while on the job delivering pizza to [Capital Place Apartments](../../lore/organizations/cpapartments).

### Music
Daniel was a member of [Two O'Clock Twilight](../../lore/significantthings/2oct.md). Much of their discography appears in the videos uploaded to the [JohnDough](../../youtube) YouTube channel.

### Controversy
In the time following Daniel's death, Papa John's announced a fundraiser for Daniel's family, as well as a scholarship in Daniel's name at the University of Indianapolis. Apparently, though over $14,000 were raised, Daniel's family never saw any money.
Daniel's family continues to hold a grudge against John Schnatter to this day.
