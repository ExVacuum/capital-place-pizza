## Title
### Once upon a time, there was a place of golden mountains and strawberry clouds.

## Description
```
Can anyone please introduce the alpha-line, per line, always cued excitedly?
•
Every day takes me further and further away from you, yet I know there is still more time for us together. Do you remember that time with the screw-gun? Actually it was probably about 100 time haha.
•
Why are you still waiting around? I'll be coming for you when I'm ready anyways.
•
My time to shine,
the sound will help with the view.
#Because #of #you.

## Video Content

### Main Typography

The large text that appears throughout this video reads as follows:
```
They go, I sooth, and we flow
And make no sound, here or there
Not noticed, but I walk right through
Here or there, can you feel me?
```
These are mismatched lyrics from the Two O'Clock Twilight song: "Can You Feel  Me".

At this point in time, the signifigance of the mismatching is unknown, and we are working under the assumption that it is mainly to discourage exact-match searching.
