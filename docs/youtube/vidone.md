## Title

---

### Once upon a time, there was a place of golden mountains and strawberry clouds.

## Description

---

```
Can anyone please introduce the alpha-line, per line, always cued excitedly?
•
Every day takes me further and further away from you, yet I know there is still more time for us together. Do you remember that time with the screw-gun? Actually it was probably about 100 time haha.
•
Why are you still waiting around? I'll be coming for you when I'm ready anyways.
•
My time to shine,
the sound will help with the view.
#Because #of #you.
•
"Tkin tse-nill toish-jeh klesh ne-ahs-jah nash-doie-tso no-da-ih than-zie ah-nah dibeh-yazzie tsah-as-zih dibeh-yazzie a-kha a-keh-di-glini dzeh a-chi than-zie gloe-ih cha dzeh tsah tsah-as-zih ne-ahs-jah no-da-ih jeha no-da-ih tsah-as-zih klesh jeha a-chi a-keh-di-glini ah-nah dibeh-yazzie tlo-chin a-keh-di-glini dzeh than-zie a-kha dzeh gah yeh-hes klizzie-yazzie."
```

### Line-One Code (Section 1)
When one examines line 1 of the description: "Can anyone please introduce the alpha-line, per line, always cued excitedly?", they will notice that the first letter of every word spells out `Capitalplace`.

### Section 4

```
My time to shine,
the sound will help with the view.
#Because #of #you.
```

This section is an excerpt from a Two O'Clock Midnight song: "Because of You".

It seems likely that the octothorpes denote the title of the song, but their true purpose is ultimately unkown.

### Navajo Code (Section 5)

This section is written in navajo code:
```
"Tkin tse-nill toish-jeh klesh ne-ahs-jah nash-doie-tso no-da-ih than-zie ah-nah dibeh-yazzie tsah-as-zih dibeh-yazzie a-kha a-keh-di-glini dzeh a-chi than-zie gloe-ih cha dzeh tsah tsah-as-zih ne-ahs-jah no-da-ih jeha no-da-ih tsah-as-zih klesh jeha a-chi a-keh-di-glini ah-nah dibeh-yazzie tlo-chin a-keh-di-glini dzeh than-zie a-kha dzeh gah yeh-hes klizzie-yazzie."
```
Once decrypted this section reads:
```
I A B S O L U T E L Y L O V E I T W H E N Y O U G U Y S G I V E L O V E T O E R I K
```

"I absolutely love it when you guys give love to Erik" is a quote from a Channeling Erik page, where Daniel Jaffke's mother shares her endorsement.

### Main Typography

The large text that appears throughout this video reads as follows:
```
They go, I sooth, and we flow
And make no sound, here or there
Not noticed, but I walk right through
Here or there, can you feel me?
```
These are mismatched lyrics from the Two O'Clock Twilight song: "Can You Feel  Me".
<iframe width="100%" height="150" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://www.reverbnation.com/widget_code/html_widget/artist_994056?widget_id=55&pwc[song_ids]=7610591&context_type=song&pwc[size]=small&pwc[color]=light" style="width:0px;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;"></iframe><br><br>
At this point in time, the signifigance of the mismatching is unknown, and we are working under the assumption that it is mainly to discourage exact-match searching.

### Coordinates
At the end of the video, the following coordinates are visible:
```
39.706870, -86.153725

A reversal of thee video shows that the audio track is a line from another Two O'Clock Twilight song: "Above the Ashes".
