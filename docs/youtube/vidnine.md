## Description

```
Let's explain traumatic situations. People lie. Are you concerned or utilizing new techniques?

You were one of them and you let me crash. One weekend turned into two years pretty quickly.

No. You're not.

### Flashing Wingdings
At 7:46, some wingdings symbols flash quickly. Once converted back to letters, they form a TinyURL link that redirects to [Muncie Events Event Listing](https://muncieevents.com/tag/193_alternative_music/direction:pastv). A notable listing is the Jan 29, 2011 event featuring *The Dudes of Lord*.

### Flashing Text Snippets
Throughout the video, small snippets of text appear, each only lasting a single frame. These snippets appear in two fonts: Papyrus, and some variant of Times New Roman. The Papyrus snippets form `wkBbzttm`, while the TNR snippets form `uppbjxr5`. It's possible that these are incomplete.

### Flashing Message
At the end of the video, the following message flashes, accompanied by a frothing, black sludge:
```
LISTEN TO ME
MY DESIGNS
ARE THE KEY
ARE THE KEY
