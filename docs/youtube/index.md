The videos uploaded have contained information of great significance to the ARG, and even within the titles and descriptions, narratives appear to be formed (courtesy of ThatOnePerson2000):

## Parable (Titles)

Once upon a time, there was a place of golden mountains and strawberry clouds, and it was as Treacherous as it was Beautiful. And, in this place, there lived a baker, who baked better than any other baker. Realizing this made the baker feel special, so he worked harder. That hard work paid off, as word of the quality of his goods spread across the land. He felt pretty good, but he also became complacent. Did it matter? His wealth was growing faster than any problem could. 
As the money piled up, the baker found himself surrounded by agreeable people. Soon, people he would never meet would be baking his pies, everywhere. "If people are willing to pick up my pizzas, maybe they'd be willing to have them delivered too." ...and they WERE willing! So he crafted a fleet to deliver his goods. The baker could hang his hat in peace as his shark-fin armada delivered his fantastic feasts. They dotted the landscape like neon fireflies, filled with goods. Hot and fresh, those goods brought joy and excitement to everyone. "I have the best breadsticks in the whole land!" he declared, throwing his cap on the ground. 
They WERE good, perhaps the best, but the baker had a problem. He was a major dickhead, and everyone who knew him, hated him. Even his queen. ...even his supposed "best friend." 
Despite this, the baker refused to accept any responsibility.

## Eulogy (Descriptions)

Every day takes me further and further away from you, yet I know there is still more time for us together. Do you remember that time with the screw-gun? Actually it was probably about 100 time haha.

There was that one time when those kids got in my way, so I scooted quick to dodge. I ended up getting stung by the scorpion and my back hurt for weeks. You said it could be worse.

Sometimes I drive by the old building and think about our time together, and what it really meant. What it really means.

One time, you bought that kid some cigarettes, and I was surprised and angry. You just said, "They'll get 'em somehow." I never thought about that somehow until now.

Then there was that time we drove to all those spots, sleeping in our cars along the way.

We took a trip south to Louisville, and, while I was still a kid, I tried to act a lot bigger than I actually was. You protected me then, so I'll protect you know. At least I'll try.

So the week it all went down, was rough. Exhaustion and economic worries had me day-walking. My only anchor at the time were the few friends I had left.

I'm sorry I ratted you out. In retrospect, what you did was amazing.

You were one of them and you let me crash. One weekend turned into two years pretty quickly.

Why did you have to die?

I'm still here, though. I'm still here.
