**The Channel Profile Picture**

On October 30, 2019, the YouTube channel [JohnDough](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Ebq-NNBboBxy1fRrRj2cA) was created.

[Channel Profile Picture]: ../assets/img/unnamed.jpg

The videos uploaded have contained information of great significance to the ARG, and even within the titles and descriptions, narratives appear to be formed (courtesy of ThatOnePerson2000):

## Overarching Narratives

Within the titles and descriptions of the videos uploaded, two continuous narratives are apparent.

<details style="background-color: #ecf1f1;padding: 10px">
<summary> 
<b style="font-weight:600;">1. The Parable (Titles)</b>
</summary>
<br>

<p style="background-color: rgba(207,207,207,0.93);border-radius: 5px;padding: 10px;">
Once upon a time, there was a place of golden mountains and strawberry clouds, and it was as Treacherous as it was Beautiful. And, in this place, there lived a baker, who baked better than any other baker. Realizing this made the baker feel special, so he worked harder. That hard work paid off, as word of the quality of his goods spread across the land. He felt pretty good, but he also became complacent. Did it matter? His wealth was growing faster than any problem could. 
As the money piled up, the baker found himself surrounded by agreeable people. Soon, people he would never meet would be baking his pies, everywhere. "If people are willing to pick up my pizzas, maybe they'd be willing to have them delivered too." ...and they WERE willing! So he crafted a fleet to deliver his goods. The baker could hang his hat in peace as his shark-fin armada delivered his fantastic feasts. They dotted the landscape like neon fireflies, filled with goods. Hot and fresh, those goods brought joy and excitement to everyone. "I have the best breadsticks in the whole land!" he declared, throwing his cap on the ground. 
They WERE good, perhaps the best, but the baker had a problem. He was a major dickhead, and everyone who knew him, hated him. Even his queen. ...even his supposed "best friend." 
Despite this, the baker refused to accept any responsibility.

<b style="font-weight:600;">2. The Eulogy (Descriptions)</b>
</summary>
<br>
<p style="background-color: rgba(207,207,207,0.93);border-radius: 5px;padding: 10px;">
Every day takes me further and further away from you, yet I know there is still more time for us together. Do you remember that time with the screw-gun? Actually it was probably about 100 time haha.
<br><br>
There was that one time when those kids got in my way, so I scooted quick to dodge. I ended up getting stung by the scorpion and my back hurt for weeks. You said it could be worse.
<br><br>
Sometimes I drive by the old building and think about our time together, and what it really meant. What it really means.
<br><br>
One time, you bought that kid some cigarettes, and I was surprised and angry. You just said, "They'll get 'em somehow." I never thought about that somehow until now.
<br><br>
Then there was that time we drove to all those spots, sleeping in our cars along the way.
<br><br>
We took a trip south to Louisville, and, while I was still a kid, I tried to act a lot bigger than I actually was. You protected me then, so I'll protect you know. At least I'll try.
<br><br>
So the week it all went down, was rough. Exhaustion and economic worries had me day-walking. My only anchor at the time were the few friends I had left.
<br><br>
I'm sorry I ratted you out. In retrospect, what you did was amazing.
<br><br>
You were one of them and you let me crash. One weekend turned into two years pretty quickly.
<br><br>
Why did you have to die?
<br><br>
I'm still here, though. I'm still here.

One time, you bought that kid some cigarettes, and I was surprised and angry. You just said, "They'll get 'em somehow." I never thought about that somehow until now.

In base10, the transcript is <code>7 14 25 18 8 29 17 24</code> 👿  <code>2 26</code> 👿 <code>18 22 27 19 16 26 17 33</code>
<br><br>
Encoded to base36 starting at the top-left corner as 0, the ciphertext reads <code>7EPI8THO 2Q IMRJGQHX</code>. Starting with A, it reads <code>HOZSI3RY C0 SW1TQ0R7</code>.
<br><br>
The signifigance of these emojis is yet unknown, nor is any connection to the emojis found in this video's description. This issue is considered highly important. The most simple solution, given the fact that 36 emojis are presented, is a base36 system. However, attempts so far have been unsuccessful.
<br><br>
The line of emojis that appears at the bottom of the screen over the course of the video is clearly of some importance, and any attempts at solving this are encouraged. A curious observation is that the demon emoji occurs multiple times in the bottom line, but never in the main set. A current theory is that the demon serves as a word-separating character.
<br><br>
Another mystery regarding the emojis is the larger, eyeless emojis which begin appearing after the first display of the set.

<h3> Video Playing in Background </h3>

Throughout the video, audio from an offscreen video source plays. The first audio heard sounds like a man saying "don't go", over and over again. This is followed by an instrumental music track. 
At 0:55, two women's voices can be heard. What is said is largely unintelligible. At 1:34, the man's voice resumes. This is followed by another dialogue, equally difficult to make out. This continues for some time.
At 3:13, an anti-vaping ad from a campaign created by the Indiana Department of Health is played:

<br>
The unintelligible conversation continues after this. At 8:06, an RTV6 Broadcast segment regarding drug-laced candy is played, although it has not been located yet. After this, a piece of promotional material for Herron School of Art and Design is played. This has also not been located. After this, one more unintelligible dialogue is spoken, and then the pizza is finished, and the man on the floor tries to get a hold of someone, presumably his captor, by saying "I'm done." in an increasingly exasperated tone.

<h3> Voicemail Recording </h3>
At the beginning of the video, a voicemail recording is played:

<p style="background-color: rgba(207,207,207,0.93);border-radius: 5px;padding: 10px;">
Cheese pizza.
<br>
CHEESE!!!
</p>

This recording is from a call placed to (317) 732-5009, when the answering machine was still that of Capital Place Pizza. The call was made by <a href="https://github.com/hyperliskdev">Hyperlisk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ExVacuum">Silas</a>.
The "Cheese pizza" portion can also be heard upon reversing the video:

<h3> Shitpost? </h3>
At this point in time, it seems entirely possible that the author merely found the call amusing and made a shitpost out of it. However, we cannot rule anything out yet.

The corresponding TinyURL link leads to this <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sk8mama/71308871/in/photostream/">Flickr photo</a> by sk8mama, a South Bend skater and mother. The albums associated with the image are "Cody" and "Ultra Violet Skatepark, Indianapolis". It is incredibly likely that Ultra Violet is connected to Infrared.

<h3> Heading </h3>

The heading text at the bottom of the video reads "Joncalli Computer Club", an obvious nod to <a href="../lore/organizations/roncalli">Roncalli High School</a>, the focus of the <a href="../reddit/pope">pope</a> puzzle. However, Roncalli does not have a computer club.

The corresponding TinyURL link leads to the following document:

It is tax return form for an affordable housing organization.

<h3> Background </h3>

The background of this video appears to be shots of the exterior of the bathroom construction used to imprison <a href="../lore/characters/jon">Jon Doe</a>, as is suggested by what appears to be the colourful glow of the toilet bowl from <a href="video-twenty-one">video 21</a> through the door slit at the end of the video.

<h3> Annual Hangover </h3>
<br>

The title of this video is strange, given that it does not appear to relate to the previous titles' apparent narrative. Given that the title is annual hangover, we can infer that January 31st is a night of heavy drinking.
January 31st is the anniversary of the death of <a href="../lore/characters/daniel">Daniel Jaffke</a>.

<h2> Description </h2>

<p style="background-color: rgba(207,207,207,0.93);border-radius: 5px;padding: 10px;">
How to escape your tunnel.
<br><br>
STEP 1: Ignore it
<br>
If you wake up inside of a tunnel, your first instinct may be to just ignore it. Trust that instinct. Close your eyes and pretend you're hiding under a bridge or asleep in your car. Think of your favorite smells. Pretend to answer your phone -- you've been doing it all year anyways.
<br><br>
STEP 2: Yell at it
<br>
When the music comes on and someone throws an old laptop at you, the time has come to yell at your tunnel. Use a voice that hurts your own ears for best results. Curse the tunnel and everything it stands for -- or plot out ways to destroy it.
<br><br>
STEP 3: Bribe it
Yelling is sure to attract attention. Offer your tunnel impossible favors for a time machine.
<br><br>
STEP 3: Just Give Up Already
<br>
Wake up on the floor every morning, tasting acid and forgetting when you fell asleep. Get nothing done for a while.
<br><br>
STEP 5: Escape
<br>
Once you see the way out, walk towards it. How long this step takes depends on your tunnel. Feel free to backtrack. Take as many breaks as you need along the way.
<br><br>
I think you can make it, but there's something I want you to know right now - even if you escape, you'll never celebrate this accomplishment. That's what you'll be up against. As intimidating as that sounds, it's worth it.
</p>

<h3> Laptop (Section 2) </h3>

Section 2 of the description mentions an old laptop being thrown into the tunnel. This potentially provides some context as to how <a href="../lore/characters/jon">Jon Doe</a> was able to communicate with the outside world.

<h2> Video Content </h2>

<hr>

<h3> Background </h3>

This video appears to depict the moments leading up to and including the <a href="../lore/characters/jon">escape of Jon Doe</a> mentioned in the CCC Discord server the previous night. Jon is lying on the floor until a slice of pizza is thrown into the room, landing in the toilet, which glows identically to the light seen in <a href="video-twenty#background">video 20</a>, and features the bidet mentioned in Jon's <a href="../lore/characters/jon">third conversation</a>.
The pizza is removed from the toilet, and it sounds like Jon attempts to wash it using the sink. Oddly, the majority of this video appears to be from the first-person perspective of Jon, as though we are seeing everything through his eyes. This is a perspective we have not experienced up to this point, and it seems strange given how grounded in reality everything up to this point was. The video ends with Jon punching through the flimsy drywall and plywood wall of the bathroom construction, and creates a hole large enough to crawl through. 
The view switches to a camera as Jon crawls to freedom.
