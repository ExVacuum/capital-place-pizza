## Video Content

---

### UIS OYRENIN? LGTAE
At the beginning of the video, this text appears.
```
UIS OYRENIN? LGTAE
```
Its purpose is currently unknown.

---

### The Poseur
The following poem(?) is displayed over the course of the first segment of the video:
```
The Poseur
Hides in Plain Sight
Seeking Validation
It does not change with Time
Failing to Start
Failing to Stop
Failing at Everything
"You're in this for the long haul"
"I never agreed to any of this!"
Why so negative?
Poseur
```
Its purpose is currently unknown.

---

### Falling Characters
Throughout the video, blocky characters fall, forming two distinct groupings:
```
rpsz2wz
3177325009
```
The first of these is part of a TinyURL link, which leads to [this Disord server](https://discord.gg/Uv2V7Ps). The latter is simply the same phone number discussed above.

```

AND
IF ALL 
THIS
CEASES

EXIST
INTO
THIN
AIR
THEN

```
