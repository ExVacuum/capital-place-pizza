### Flashing Text
Throughout the video, bits of text flash for single frames.
```
All this started as a gig
One job
One check
But I found something.
Something No-one is supposed to find
something big
now they wont let me go
If I told you about it now...
You wouldn't belive it
So this is how I'm doing it
because
It's the only real way to let people know
Whats wrong with Indiana?
Whats wrong with Indiana?

Whats wrong with Indiana?
```
