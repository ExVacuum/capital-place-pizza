### Background

The background of this video appears to be shots of the exterior of the bathroom construction used to imprison [Jon Doe](../lore/characters/jon), as is suggested by what appears to be the colourful glow of the toilet bowl from [video 21](video-twenty-one) through the door slit at the end of the video.
