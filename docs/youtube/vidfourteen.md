### Video Playing in Background

Throughout the video, audio from an offscreen video source plays. The first audio heard sounds like a man saying "don't go", over and over again. This is followed by an instrumental music track. 
At 0:55, two women's voices can be heard. What is said is largely unintelligible. At 1:34, the man's voice resumes. This is followed by another dialogue, equally difficult to make out. This continues for some time.
At 3:13, an anti-vaping ad from a campaign created by the Indiana Department of Health is played:

<br>
The unintelligible conversation continues after this. At 8:06, an RTV6 Broadcast segment regarding drug-laced candy is played, although it has not been located yet. After this, a piece of promotional material for Herron School of Art and Design is played. This has also not been located. After this, one more unintelligible dialogue is spoken, and then the pizza is finished, and the man on the floor tries to get a hold of someone, presumably his captor, by saying "I'm done." in an increasingly exasperated tone.
