### ...even his supposed "best friend."

## Description 

```
When I am looking north, it's for a cause, but it's never up.
```

## Video Content

### Heading

The heading text at the bottom of the video reads "Joncalli Computer Club", an obvious nod to [Roncalli High School](../lore/organizations/roncalli), the focus of the [pope](../reddit/pope) puzzle. However, Roncalli does not have a computer club.

### Subheading

The subheader contains snippets of broken text, which form the following string:
```
rg79gkf
```

The corresponding TinyURL link leads to the following document:

<iframe src="../assets/rental.pdf" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

It is tax return form for an affordable housing organization. 
The document is from the FOUNDATION FOR AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING HOLDINGS INC, which is the same organization that sent the parcel mentioned in the [emails puzzle](../reddit/emails).
