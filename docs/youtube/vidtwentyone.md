## Title

### Annual Hangover

The title of this video is strange, given that it does not appear to relate to the previous titles' apparent narrative. Given that the title is annual hangover, we can infer that January 31st is a night of heavy drinking.
January 31st is the anniversary of the death of [Daniel Jaffke](../lore/characters/daniel).

## Description 

```
How to escape your tunnel.

STEP 1: Ignore it
If you wake up inside of a tunnel, your first instinct may be to just ignore it. Trust that instinct. Close your eyes and pretend you're hiding under a bridge or asleep in your car. Think of your favorite smells. Pretend to answer your phone -- you've been doing it all year anyways.

STEP 2: Yell at it
When the music comes on and someone throws an old laptop at you, the time has come to yell at your tunnel. Use a voice that hurts your own ears for best results. Curse the tunnel and everything it stands for -- or plot out ways to destroy it.

STEP 3: Bribe it
Yelling is sure to attract attention. Offer your tunnel impossible favors for a time machine.

STEP 3: Just Give Up Already
Wake up on the floor every morning, tasting acid and forgetting when you fell asleep. Get nothing done for a while.

STEP 5: Escape
Once you see the way out, walk towards it. How long this step takes depends on your tunnel. Feel free to backtrack. Take as many breaks as you need along the way.

I think you can make it, but there's something I want you to know right now - even if you escape, you'll never celebrate this accomplishment. That's what you'll be up against. As intimidating as that sounds, it's worth it.
```

### Laptop (Section 2)

Section 2 of the description mentions an old laptop being thrown into the tunnel. This potentially provides some context as to how [Jon Doe](../lore/characters/jon) was able to communicate with the outside world.

## Video Content

### Background

This video appears to depict the moments leading up to and including the [escape of Jon Doe](../lore/characters/jon#jons-escape) mentioned in the CCC Discord server the previous night. Jon is lying on the floor until a slice of pizza is thrown into the room, landing in the toilet, which glows identically to the light seen in [video 20](video-twenty#background), and features the bidet mentioned in Jon's [third conversation](../lore/characters/jon#third-conversation).
The pizza is removed from the toilet, and it sounds like Jon attempts to wash it using the sink. Oddly, the majority of this video appears to be from the first-person perspective of Jon, as though we are seeing everything through his eyes. This is a perspective we have not experienced up to this point, and it seems strange given how grounded in reality everything up to this point was. The video ends with Jon punching through the flimsy drywall and plywood wall of the bathroom construction, and creates a hole large enough to crawl through. 
The view switches to a camera as Jon crawls to freedom.

### Logo

At the end of the video, the [Emerson-Schnatter Apartments](../lore/organizations/esapartments) logo is visible. The significance of this is currently unknown.
