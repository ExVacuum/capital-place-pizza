## Description

```
Just Please Say Cheese? Hope Never Acquiesces To Those Escaping Reality
•
There was that one time when those kids got in my way, so I scooted quick to dodge. I ended up getting stung by the scorpion and my back hurt for weeks. You said it could be worse.
•
Something's fishy is going on here.

### Navajo Code (Section 4)

This section is written in navajo code:
```
"Gloe-ih Ah-jah Chindi A-kha Nesh-chee'd-ah Jad-ho-loni A-chin Ne-ahs-jah Gloe-ih A-chi Chuo Lin Ah-jah Gloe-ih Be-la-sana Dibeh Tse-gah Ah-nah Dah-nes-tsa Ah-jah Than-zie Ne-ahs-jah D-ah Ne-ahs-jah Gloe-ih A-chi A-woh Shush Dzeh Ba-goshi Wol-la-chee Shi-da Klesh Dzeh A-kha Chuo Tse-nill Bi-so-dih Be-la-sana Klesh Klesh, A-chi Ma-e A-chi D-ah Gloe-ih Tse-nill Klesh Wol-la-chee Dah-nes-tsa Ah-jah Bi-so-dih Ne-ahs-jah Dibeh Dibeh Ah-jah Dibeh Klesh A-chi Ne-ahs-jah Tsah Tlo-chin Dah-nes-tsa A-chi Chuo Yeh-hes Than-zie Gloe-ih Tse-nill Dibeh Shush Dah-nes-tsa Ne-ahs-jah Jad-ho-loni Ah-jah Nesh-chee Chindi Tlo-chin Gloe-ih A-chin Be-la-sana Tsah Be D-ah Lin Ah-nah Tsah-as-zih Ba-goshi Be-la-sana Ah-jad Ah-jad Ah-jah Chindi Lin A-chi Be-tas-tni Cha Dzeh Gah Ah-nah A-woh Ne-ahs-jah Tse-gah Be-la-sana A-keh-di-glini Ah-nah Yeh-hes A-woh A-woh A-kha Gloe-ih Dzeh Lha-cha-eh."
```
Once decrypted this section reads:
```
W E D O N T K N O W I F H E W A S H E R E T O T O W I T B E C A U S E O F A P A S S I F I T W A S A R E P O S S E S S I O N O R I F I T W A S B R O K E N D O W N A N D T H E Y C A L L E D H I M H E R E T O H A V E I T T O W E D
```

"We don’t know if he was here to tow it because of a pass, if it was a repossession or if it was broken down and they called him here to have it towed." is a quote from a [Fox 59 Article](https://fox59.com/2017/11/12/tow-truck-driver-shot-killed-on-the-citys-south-side/) about Steve Deputy, a tow truck driver who was killed on the job near Capital Place Apartments.
