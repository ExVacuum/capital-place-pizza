**Figure A: The Image Posted**
<br><br>
On December 14, 2019, the Reddit user [u/johndough1983](https://www.reddit.com/user/johndough1983/) created [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/codes/comments/e41d1r/this_pope_has_10_things_he_doesnt_want_you_to/), titled: "This Pope has 10 things he doesn’t want you to find out".
The post contained the above image, a horizontally inverted, modified version of the following image of Pope John XXIII:
<br>

<br>

**Figure B: The original image**
<br>

A higher-resolution image, missing some information, was also provided to the Discord by user John4-16 (Jon Doe):

## Coupon Code
Upon [Silas](http://github.com/exvacuum)' successful collection of 10 secrets, the OP responded with a comment including the following coupon code for "free garlic sticks":
```
the pope’s pizza
```

## Visible Secrets
The first few secrets can be found with the naked eye. The first step. however, is to horizontally flip the image:
<br>

<br>

### 1. The QR Code
In the top-right corner of the image, the following QR code is clearly visible:
<br>

![qr]

[qr]: ../assets/img/popepostqr.jpg
{:width="250px"}

<br>

This code leads to a [Daily Journal article](http://www.dailyjournal.net/2019/11/09/roncalli_football_claims_sectional_championship/) about the success of the [Roncalli High School](https://www.roncalli.org/) football team. Roncalli High School is a Catholic secondary school in Indianapolis.

### 2. Edge Text
The vertical edges of this image each contain half of a string of text, which when assembled form `umjpwk2`:
<br>

![edges]

[edges]: ../assets/img/popepostedges.jpg
{:width="250px"}

<br>

The corresponding TinyURL link leads to a [Daily Beast article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/indiana-high-school-football-players-bullied-and-abused-roncalli-student-with-down-syndrome-his-mom-claims) regarding the abuse of a Roncalli High School football team manger with Down Syndrome by team members.

### 3. Barcode
The barcode that runs along the bottom of the image was revealed by the Discord user John4-16 (who was later revealed to be Jon Doe) to be a repeating sequence: `- .--. ...-- ..... ----- --.. -.`:
<br>

![barcode]

[barcode]: ../assets/img/popepostbarcode.jpg
{:width="500px"}

<br>

This, when converted from morse code, creates the string `tp350zn`. The corresponding TinyURL link leads to a [Fox 59 article](https://fox59.com/2019/10/25/suspended-priest-faces-3-felony-charges-in-sex-abuse-case-involving-minor/) regarding sexual abuse charges being faced by a chaplain at Roncalli High School.

### 4. Numbering Under QR Code
The following numbering under the QR code is only present in the Reddit image:
<br>

![nums]

[nums]: ../assets/img/popepostnums.jpg
{:width="500px"}

<br>

The numbers read `19 01 25 12 05 12 14`, which when reverted from a A1Z26 substitution cipher reads: `SAYLELN`. The corresponding TinyURL link leads to an [RTV6 article](https://www.theindychannel.com/news/politics/proposal-to-block-state-funding-from-roncalli-over-counselor-controversy-fails) regarding a proposal to block state funding to Roncalli High School due to religious discrimination against an LGBT faculty member.

### 5. Wingdings
In the Reddit image, very low-resolution wingdings appear on the Pope's head:
<br>

![wingdings]

[wingdings]: ../assets/img/popepostwingdings.jpg
{:width="50px"}

<br>

Unfortunately, these do not appear in the high-resolution image. However, after careful analysis the text was found to read `v3jrqjp`. The corresponding TinyURL link leads to an [Indy Star article](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2019/02/12/roncalli-high-school-chaplain-suspended-amid-sex-abuse-allegation/2853350002/) regarding the previously mentioned allegations against the Roncalli High School chaplain.

## Image Difference
At this point in time, in order to better search for secrets, it is helpful to get the difference between the high-res posted image and the original:
<br>

![diff]

[diff]: ../assets/img/popepostdiff.jpg
{:width="500px"}

<br>

Now we are able to view almost all modifications made to the original image.

### 6. Bright Lettering
The following bright lettering dots the image from left to right:
<br>

![brightletters]

[brightletters]: ../assets/img/popeposbrightletters.jpg

The corresponding TinyURL link leads to the following RTV6 broadcast segment regarding an apology from Roncalli High School's principal for his use of the word "nigger" during a speech on language that should not be tolerated:

<br>

### 7. Red Lettering
The following red lettering runs down the side of the Pope's cloak:
<br>

![redletters]

### 8. Purple Text
The following text is slightly visible where the Pope's cheek would be:
<br>

![purpletext]

[purpletext]: ../assets/img/popepospurpletext.jpg
{:width="250px"}

<br>

```

```

The corresponding TinyURL link leads to a [WTHR article](https://www.wthr.com/article/thousands-sign-petition-decrying-punishment-roncalli-students-who-protest) regarding the public outcry against Roncalli High School's punishment of students who protest for LGBTQ+ rights.

### 9. Red Text
The following text is slightly visible on the edge of where the Pope's coat would be:
<br>

![redtext]

[redtext]: ../assets/img/popepostredtext.jpg
{:width="250px"}

<br>

```
slehfk3
```

The corresponding TinyURL link leads to an [Indy Star article](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2019/06/20/brebeuf-roncalli-and-archdiocese-indianapolis-how-cases-compare/1512209001/) comparing similar situations regarding LGBT staff members at Roncalli High School and Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School.

### 10. Red Morse
On the inside of where the Pope's cloak would be, the following morse code appears:
<br>

![redmorse]

[redmorse]: ../assets/img/popepostredmorse.jpg
{:width="250px"}

<br>

Unfortunately, due to the inconsistent spacing of the dits and dahs, a lot of trial and error was involved in forming the following transcript:
```
..- . --... .. -- -.. -...
```

When decoded from morse, this form the string: `UE7IMDB`. The corresponding TinyURL link leads to an [Indianapolis Colts article](https://www.colts.com/news/indiana-football-digest-top-games-2019-semi-finals) containing information about the Indiana Football 2019 semifinals.

### 11. White Morse
In the top-left quadrant of the image, a white morse sequence can be seen:
<br>

![whitemorse]

[whitemorse]: ../assets/img/popepostwhitemorse.jpg
{:width="250px"}

<br>

This sequence was thought to be a red herring once ten secrets had been uncovered. However, Discord user John4-16 (Jon Doe) was able to provide a transcript of the sequence:
```
...- ...-- -.- .--. --.- .-.. ---
```

When decoded from morse, this form the string: `V3KPQLO`. The corresponding TinyURL link leads to a [Daily Journal article](http://www.dailyjournal.net/2019/11/02/roncalli_football_dominates_crispus_attucks/) regarding a Roncalli High School football match that went incredibly well.

### 12. Divide Image
The next secret was discovered by accident when applying a divide color mode to the overlain images, and applying a levels filter:
<br>

![divide]

[divide]: ../assets/img/popepostdivide.jpg
