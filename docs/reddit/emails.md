## Revealing the Secrets

Pretty much all the hidden text in this image can be revealed using the rectangular marquee tool and auto contrast:

### The Secrets

```
1. $26,600,00 aggregate principal amount of city of nd variable rate mf housing revenue bonds
  
2. cumberland
  
3. kr8juov
  
4. 20-2563055

5. 5001061

6. parcel
```

The TiyURL link for secret 3 leads to a [property report card search tool](http://maps.indy.gov/AssessorPropertyCards/). If we search using the seven-digit secret 5 as the parcel code (secret 6), we get the following result:

```
Parcel Number: 5001061
State Parcel Number: 49-11-36-104-040.000-570
Full Address: 4100 CONTINENTAL CT
Owner: FOUNDATION FOR AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING INC
```

4100 Continental Court is the street address of [Capital Place Apartments](../lore/organizations/cpapartments) in Indianapolis. 

Secret 4 is the employer identification number of Farh-Lamplighter Affordable Housing Inc., mentioned in [video 19](../youtube/video-nineteen#subheading), 
located on Cumberland Parkway in Atlanta, Georgia (Secret 2).

That leaves secret 1.
```
$26,600,00 aggregate principal amount of city of nd variable rate mf housing revenue bonds
```

"nd" is likely in reference to Indianapolis, or "Indy". "mf" means multi-family. Therefore, the text could read:
```
$26,600,00 aggregate principal amount of city of Indianapolis variable rate multi-family housing revenue bonds
```
