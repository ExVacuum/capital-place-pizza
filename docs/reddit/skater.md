On November 21, 2019, the Reddit user [u/johndough1983](https://www.reddit.com/user/johndough1983/) created [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/codes/comments/dzfq29/this_dude_has_8_different_secrets_to_tell), titled: "This dude has 8 different secrets to tell".
The post contained the above image.

## Visible Secrets
The first few secrets can be found with the naked eye.

<br>

### 1. The QR Code

In the bottom-left corner of the image, the following QR code is clearly visible:
<br>

![qr]

[qr]: ../assets/img/skaterqr.jpg
{:width="250px"}

<br>

This code leads to a [LensDump Image](https://lensdump.com/i/skrinair-2.iLdReq), essentially just a high-resolution version of the posted image, lacking the QR code:

![hres]

[hres]: ../assets/img/iLdReq.png
{:width="500px"}

---

### 2. Faded Text

On the right-center of the image, the following text can be seen, very faintly:

![faded]

[faded]: ../assets/img/vehwqq4.png
{:width="250px"}

```
vehwqq4
```

The corresponding TinyURL link leads to the following [PxHere Photo](https://pxhere.com/sv/photo/668890), however for some reason the page is in Swedish.
It appears to be the original source image:

![original]

[original]: ../assets/img/skateroriginal.jpg
{:width="500px"}


---

At this point, it is helpful to re-align the image's translation:

![realigned]

[realigned]: ../assets/img/skaterreassembled.png
{:width="500px"}

---

### 3. Misaligned Text

Down the middle of the image, a column of misaligned letters can be found. Realigning them yields the following text:

![column]

[column]: ../assets/img/skatercolumn.png
{:width="50px"}

```
QKFN3CJ
```

The corresponding TinyURL link leads to timestamp 1:12 of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3D6WLWYJoE&t=72s), which happens to be [video 9](../youtube/video-nine) from the [YouTube channel](../youtube).

---

## Image Difference

At this point it is helpful to get the difference between the high-res image, and the source image:

![diff]

[diff]: ../assets/img/skaterdiff.png

---

### 4. White Text

Across the image, the following text is visible:

![whitetext]

[whitetext]: ../assets/img/skaterwhiteletters.png
{:width="100%"}

```
rqyvatq
```

The corresponding TinyURL link redirects to the [Twitter Page](https://twitter.com/thedudesoflord) of *The Dudes of Lord*, a band of which [Paul Sherfick](../lore/characters/paul) was a member.

---

### 5. Morse Code

The barcode of the image translates to morse code:

![barcode]

[barcode]: ../assets/img/skaterbarcode.png
{:width="250px"}

```
rqyvatq
```

This is the same as the previous secret, which is quite odd. We determined the order of the barcode stripes, as the letter r happens to be next the the first set of lines which form "r" in morse.

---

### 6. Leftover Text

Once we discard the r under the trucks, and the LR on the upper trucks as a reading order indicator, we are left with the following info:

![leftover]

[leftover]:../assets/img/skaterleftovers.png
{:width="500px"}

```
XQK89Q
```

The corresponding TinyURL link redirects to [MySpace](https://myspace.com/). The significance of this is ultimately unknown, however given the running theme we can assume that the [Dudes of Lord MySpace page](https://myspace.com/thedudesoflordband) is significant.

---

## 7. Levels

After modifying the levels of the difference between the original and modified images, the following text is visible:

![levels]

[levels]:../assets/img/skaterlevels.png
{:width="500px"}

```
tnukqd9
```

The corresponding TinyURL link leads to the Dudes of Lord [ReverbNation Page](https://www.reverbnation.com/thedudesoflord).

## 8. Hex Code

When opened in a hex editor, the following message is repeated 31 times at the end of the high-resolution image:

```
So you've made it this far out on the branches without falling. 
Impressive. 
Does it make sense yet, or do you need me to hold your hand a bit longer? 
Try this one - vt64rz3
```

The corresponding TinyURL link redirects to an [Indy Star article](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2017/06/09/how-ex-cop-david-bisard-slashed-his-16-year-sentence-serve-only-4/379026001/)
regarding the early release of former IMPD officer [David Bisard](../lore/characters/david).
