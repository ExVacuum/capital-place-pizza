On January 21, 2020, the Reddit user [u/johndough1983](https://www.reddit.com/user/johndough1983/) created [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/codes/comments/erzkcm/13_things_hidden_inside_13_stripes/), titled: "13 Things Hidden Inside 13 Stripes". 
[Another Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ARG/comments/es2cq0/google_adam_driver_rebukes_chastened_historian/) was made that had the alternate title: "Google Adam Driver Rebukes Chastened Historian With Hidden History".
The post contained the above image.

Meanwhile, on #the-computer channel of the [Circle City Contamination Discord server](https://discord.gg/Uv2V7Ps), the following alternate version of the image was posted:

This image had a strange filename: "2019-12-17_14_10_28-Video_5_-_CPPARG_Knowledge_Base" which references the [video 5](../youtube/video-five) page on this very site.

No solution has be discovered so far. See [#lines](https://discord.gg/wZ5DaPJ) in the Discord server for more information.
